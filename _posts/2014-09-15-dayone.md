Day One got off to a good start. We began with an introductory talk from the Camden Collective. They let us know about all the fantasitc platforms they are putting into the area to produce a more successful and sustainable Camden.

Founders and Coders leader Dan Sofer, then gave us our roles of responsibility for the week ahead. The first task is to build a group blog. This will be a permanent record of our work over the next seven weeks. We will use it to share with each other and to showcase Founders & Coders to the world.

Our Roles

* Project Owner
* Project Manager
* Tester
* Repo Owner

Here's to a successful week
