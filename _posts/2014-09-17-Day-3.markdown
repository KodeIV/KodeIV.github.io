title: "Day 3"

After the impossibly steep learning curve that Max has been attempting to climb over the past two days in the world of github we have deided to give him a bit of a break and focus on building the html and CSS. We have been doing this on jsbin. We have found that this is a good environment to build becuse it separates the html, css and a preview of how the website is developing into three columns on one screen. 

Once everyone was happy we transported our content onto jekyll! boom.
