*Prototypes

#Every JavaScript object has a prototype.
#The prototype is also an object.
#All JavaScript objects inherit their properties and
methods from their prototype.

#Objects created using an object literal, or with new Object(),
#inherit from a prototype called Object.prototype.

#Objects created with new Date() inherit the Date.prototype.

#The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype chain.

#All JavaScript objects (Date, Array, RegExp, Function, ....)
inherit from the Object.prototype.
